# ghostty-nvim-config

install ghostty, nvim, and ripgrep (faster file searching):
- [ ] `brew install --cask ghostty`
- [ ] `brew install neovim`
- [ ] `brew install ripgrep`

Heavily inspired by [marshmalon](https://vineeth.io/posts/neovim-setup) and The Primeagen.<br/>
Place the nvim and ghostty config structure and files into your root `.config/`<br/>
Use `:Lazy` to update and install all your nvim configs

Within `.config/nvim/lua/karl/...` contains the lua files used by lazy, if you use this configuration, use your name or username instead as the folder path such as `.config/nvim/lua/[@username]/...`
