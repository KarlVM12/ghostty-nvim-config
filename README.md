# ghostty-nvim-config

install ghostty, nvim, and ripgrep (faster file searching):
- [ ] brew install --cask ghostty
- [ ] brew install neovim
- [ ] brew install ripgrep

Heavily inspired by [marshmalon](https://vineeth.io/posts/neovim-setup) and The Primeagen.<br/>
Place the nvim and ghostty config structure and files into .config/
